# 4 Letter Domain Availability

This PHP script was built by me in 2015 as an experiment. It scans all 4 letter domains. First, it creates a MySQL database, then scans and writes results to the database. In the case of crash, it is able to pick up where it left off. It is using https://github.com/HelgeSverre/Domain-Availability.

# 4 Letter Domain Availability Scanner

This PHP script was built by me in 2015 as an experiment. It scans all 4 letter com and net domains. First, it creates a MySQL database, then scans and writes results to the database and continuously on the screen. In the case of crash, it is able to pick up where it left off. It uses https://github.com/HelgeSverre/Domain-Availability for scanning.
